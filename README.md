# Sentiment-Analysis-System-
Sentiment Analysis System

A Python-based project which focuses on applying machine learning techniques to analyze and classify data across multiple domains such as sentiment analysis, image classification, and more.

üåü Features
- Sentiment Analysis (Text Classification): Classifies text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- Binary Classification: Classifies images into two categories (e.g., flowers).
- Multiclass Classification: Classifies images of various dog breeds.
- Face Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes facial expressions to detect emotions.
- User-Friendly: Easy-to-understand visualizations of results.
- Real-World Applications: Applicable for social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and emotion recognition.
 
üîß Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, InceptionV3, ImageDataGenerator
- Tools: VS Code, Google Colab

**Note: This project involves training models with datasets for sentiment analysis and image data for classification. The models can be trained on platforms like Google Colab or VS Code. You may need to provide relevant datasets to train the models for accurate results.

üåç Applications
- Sentiment Analysis: Monitor customer sentiments on social media platforms.
- Image Classification: Identify and classify different categories of objects, such as flowers and dog breeds.
- Emotion Recognition: Analyze faces to detect emotional expressions for interactive applications.

üìñ Project Workflow
1. Text Classification: Trained models to classify text data into sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).
2. Binary Classification: Classified images into two categories (e.g., flowers).
3. Multiclass Classification: Built a dog breed classifier with multiple categories.
4. Face Sentiment Analysis: Implemented face emotion detection using deep learning techniques.
5. Visualization: Provided visual representation of results for better understanding.

üí° Future Scope
- Improve model accuracy by adding more labeled data for training.
- Integrate real-time sentiment analysis from social media.
- Expand to additional classification tasks, including object detection.
